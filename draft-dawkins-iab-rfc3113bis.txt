1.  Introduction

   This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves
   as the basis for establishing the collaboration between 3GPP and
   IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical
   specification that facilitate maximum interoperability with existing
   (fixed and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and protocols.

   Each organization will operate according to their own rules and
   procedures including rules governing IPR policy, specification
   elaboration, approval and maintenance.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses significant terminology that is specialized to
   IETF, 3GPP, or their areas of work.  See Appendix A for definitions
   of acronyms.  The organizational definitions can be found in their
   respective web-sites.

3.  Reasons For Collaboration

3.1.  3GPP use of IETF Internet Standards

   In the further development of 3GPP specifications, the benefit of
   adopting Internet specifications has been identified.

   The preferred 3GPP approach is to use the Internet standards
   unchanged, if feasible.  In any case, 3GPP has no intention to
   duplicate work performed in IETF.

   However, while this document recognizes the importance of 3GPP
   interoperability with the existing Internet and hence the use of IETF
   standards, 3GPP recognizes that additions or modifications might be
   needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfill the
   needs of 3GPP.  In such cases, 3GPP will take its concerns directly
   to the appropriate IETF working groups for resolution, or to an
   appropriate Area Director if no appropriate working group can be
   found.

3.2.  IETF access to 3GPP Wireless expertise

   The technical work in 3GPP is organized in Technical Specification
   Groups TSGs each with their area of responsibilities.  TSG-RAN and
   TSG-GERAN are responsible for the Radio Access networks based on
   UTRAN and GERAN and thus the experts in the areas of the
   characteristics of the physical transport.  TSG CN is responsible for
   the Mobility Management and other core network protocol and
   functionalities.  TSG-T is responsible for Terminal aspects and
   applications.  TSG-SA is responsible for the service and system
   aspects including the overall architecture, security and O&M aspects.
   Contacts for the TSGs can be found on the 3GPP web-site
   http://www.3gpp.org/.

4.  Document Sharing

   Both 3GPP and IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents that are
   of mutual interest.

   3GPP documents are available on its official web-site
   (http://www.3gpp.org/) and is open to anyone.  IETF documents,
   including preliminary working documents ("Internet Drafts") are
   available on its web-site (http://www.ietf.org/) and various shadow
   sites.

   IETF representatives can obtain information about the 3GPP document
   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant 3GPP contact
   points indicated at the 3GPP web-site http://www.3gpp.org/.

   3GPP representatives can obtain information about the IETF document
   and web-site structures by contacting the relevant IETF contact
   points (the Area Directors indicated at the IETF web-site
   http://www.ietf.org/).

5.  Communication

   Whenever possible, informal communication at working level is
   encouraged.

   The vast majority of the technical discussions and decision making in
   both IETF and 3GPP is done over mailing lists.  Both 3GPP and IETF
   web sites contain information concerning the associated mailing
   lists.

   It is recommended that interested individuals subscribe to and
   participate in these lists.

   When deemed necessary, formal communication between 3GPP and IETF is
   also permitted.  Relevant IETF Area Directors and 3GPP technical
   leadership are encouraged and authorized to facilitate such
   communications when needed.

6.  Rapporteurs/coordinators

6.1.  IETF coordination support in 3GPP

   An IETF rapporteur function is established in 3GPP TSG-SA.

   The individual(s) appointed to undertake the responsibility of this
   function should be the initial contact point in 3GPP for matters
   pertaining to the 3GPP-IETF cooperation.  Of course, the chairman of
   TSG-SA can always be contacted.

   The 3GPP-IETF rapporteur function, therefore, is expected to work
   with the concerned working groups and TSGs and support the
   interaction between 3GPP and IETF.

6.2.  3GPP Liaison in IETF

   The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the
   working groups.  However, IETF has a limited number of liaison
   relationships with other organizations when conditions warrant the
   appointment of a specific person.

   The appointment, by the IAB, of a specific person to function as a
   "3GPP liaison" is proposed.

   The role of the 3GPP Liaison is to act as an initial contact point in
   IETF for administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot
   easily be handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by
   interactions with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).  It is
   agreed that the role does not carry the expectation of attendance at
   3GPP meetings or participation in 3GPP administrative processes and
   anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to this individual will
   be carried out by electronic mail.  It is understood that the liaison
   will not have the ability to make exceptions to, or special
   provisions for, IETF policies and procedures.

7.  Participation

   In order to assist the information flow between the organizations,
   the IETF can on per case basis appoint a rapporteur to participate
   and represent IETF at 3GPP technical meetings.

   IETF meetings are open to any interested individuals.

   3GPP partners (OPs, MRPs) or individual members can participate in
   any of the IETF meetings, in accordance with the existing IETF
   procedures.

8.  Security Considerations

   This type of non-protocol document does not directly affect the
   security of the Internet.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
