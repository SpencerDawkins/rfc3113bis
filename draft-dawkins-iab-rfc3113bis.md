--- abstract

This document describes the standardization collaboration between 3GPP and IETF.

# Introduction

This document contains a set of principles and guidelines that serves as the basis for establishing the collaboration between 3GPP and IETF, with the objective of securing timely development of technical specification that facilitate maximum interoperability with existing (fixed and mobile) Internet systems, devices, and protocols.

Each organization will operate according to their own rules and procedures including rules governing IPR policy, specification elaboration, approval and maintenance.

# Conventions and Definitions

This document uses significant terminology that is specialized to IETF, 3GPP, or their areas of work.  See {{acronyms}} for definitions of acronyms.  The organizational definitions can be found in their respective web-sites.

# Reasons For Collaboration

## 3GPP use of IETF Internet Standards

In the further development of 3GPP specifications, the benefit of adopting Internet specifications has been identified.

The preferred 3GPP approach is to use the Internet standards unchanged, if feasible.
In any case, 3GPP has no intention to duplicate work performed in IETF.

However, while this document recognizes the importance of 3GPP interoperability with the existing Internet and hence the use of IETF standards, 3GPP recognizes that additions or modifications might be needed in order to make the IETF internet specification fulfill the needs of 3GPP.
In such cases, 3GPP will take its concerns directly to the appropriate IETF working groups for resolution, or to an appropriate Area Director if no appropriate working group can be found.

## IETF access to 3GPP Wireless expertise

The technical work in 3GPP is organized in Technical Specification Groups TSGs each with their area of responsibilities.
TSG-RAN and TSG-GERAN are responsible for the Radio Access networks based on UTRAN and GERAN and thus the experts in the areas of the    characteristics of the physical transport.
TSG CN is responsible for the Mobility Management and other core network protocol and functionalities.
TSG-T is responsible for Terminal aspects and applications.
TSG-SA is responsible for the service and system aspects including the overall architecture, security and O&M aspects.
Contacts for the TSGs can be found on the 3GPP web-site http://www.3gpp.org/.

# Document Sharing

Both 3GPP and IETF encourage the sharing of draft documents that are of mutual interest.

3GPP documents are available on its official web-site (http://www.3gpp.org/) and is open to anyone.
IETF documents, including preliminary working documents ("Internet Drafts") are available on its web-site (http://www.ietf.org/) and various shadow    sites.

IETF representatives can obtain information about the 3GPP document and web-site structures by contacting the relevant 3GPP contact points indicated at the 3GPP web-site http://www.3gpp.org/.

3GPP representatives can obtain information about the IETF document and web-site structures by contacting the relevant IETF contact points (the Area Directors indicated at the IETF web-site http://www.ietf.org/).

# Communication

Whenever possible, informal communication at working level is encouraged.

The vast majority of the technical discussions and decision making in both IETF and 3GPP is done over mailing lists.
Both 3GPP and IETF web sites contain information concerning the associated mailing lists.

It is recommended that interested individuals subscribe to and participate in these lists.

When deemed necessary, formal communication between 3GPP and IETF is also permitted.
Relevant IETF Area Directors and 3GPP technical leadership are encouraged and authorized to facilitate such communications when needed.

# Rapporteurs/coordinators

## IETF coordination support in 3GPP

An IETF rapporteur function is established in 3GPP TSG-SA.

The individual(s) appointed to undertake the responsibility of this function should be the initial contact point in 3GPP for matters pertaining to the 3GPP-IETF cooperation.
Of course, the chairman of TSG-SA can always be contacted.

The 3GPP-IETF rapporteur function, therefore, is expected to work with the concerned working groups and TSGs and support the interaction between 3GPP and IETF.

## 3GPP Liaison in IETF

The preferred way for organizations to work with IETF is through the working groups.
However, IETF has a limited number of liaison relationships with other organizations when conditions warrant the appointment of a specific person.

The appointment, by the IAB, of a specific person to function as a "3GPP liaison" is proposed.

The role of the 3GPP Liaison is to act as an initial contact point in IETF for administrative aspects of this collaboration that cannot easily be handled in other ways (e.g., at a technical level by interactions with IETF Working Groups or Area Directors).
It is agreed that the role does not carry the expectation of attendance at 3GPP meetings or participation in 3GPP administrative processes and anticipated that all liaison efforts assigned to this individual will be carried out by electronic mail.
It is understood that the liaison will not have the ability to make exceptions to, or special provisions for, IETF policies and procedures.

# Participation

In order to assist the information flow between the organizations, the IETF can on per case basis appoint a rapporteur to participate and represent IETF at 3GPP technical meetings.

IETF meetings are open to any interested individuals.

3GPP partners (OPs, MRPs) or individual members can participate in any of the IETF meetings, in accordance with the existing IETF procedures.
